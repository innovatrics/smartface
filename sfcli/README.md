Exit code of sfcli utility is 0 in case of success and nonzero number in case of any failure.

### Syntax

```
sfcli command [subcommand] [option1, option2, ...]
```

##### Example:
Command "video" with subcommand "get" with no options
```

Will list all existing video processors. 

##### Options:
Option are supported in long form prepended by double dash:
```
sfcli video get --streamId 34
```
as well in short form.
```
sfcli video get -s:34
sfcli video get -s=34
sfcli video get -s 34
```

### API destination

##### HTTP

Target HTTP API destination must defined by "--url" option. Value should be address of SmartFace HTTP endpoint with apropriate port.

#### watchlistmember

This command mnipulates with watchlistmember entities.

```
Options:
  -?|-h|--help     Show help information

Commands:
  register         Register single watchlist member
  registerFromDir  Register WatchlistMember entities from photos in directory in format {watchlistmember_externalId}.(jpeg|jpg|png)
```

##### watchlistmember register

Create or update watchlist member with all required related entities. Unique ExternalIds are supposed to be generated by clients (e.g. GUIDs or external id from another system).

Create :
If ExternalId of watchlist(s) or watchlist member do not exists in database, new ones with provided external id will be created for you automatically.

Replace:
If you want to link watchlist member to other watchlist(s) or change photos of existing watchlist member, use existing external Ids of entities.

NOTE: All watchlist member related data that exists before callling this method will be deleted/unlinked and new one by payload will be recreated.

```
Options:
  -e|--externalId             
  -w|--watchlistsExternalIds  
  -p|--photos <FILE>          
  -?|-h|--help                Show help information
```

Example:
```sh
$ sfcli --url http://localhost:8099 watchlistmember register -e:external_wlMember_id -w:123 -w:567 -p:face1.jpg -p:face2.jpg
```
This command will create/replace watchlist member with faces from photo files (face1.jpg, face2.jpg) and link this watchlist member to watchlists with external ids (123, 567).

##### watchlistmember registerFromDir

This command will register multiple watchlist members from directory with photos. It will take all image files from given directory which name conforms with format  "{watchlistmember_externalId}.(jpeg|jpg|png)" and register photos for each externalId as watchlist member.
Example file name "ext123.jpeg". 

###### Option --metaDataFile
If you need to fill additional data to watchlist member like FullName, DisplayName or Note then use option -m. 
WatchlistMember will be registred from json file which contains array of objects, where each object represents data for watchlist member.
This json file is expected to be in specified directory (option --dirToPhotos). Name of json file is irrelevant. 

```
Options:
  -w|--watchlistsExternalIds
  -d|--dirToPhotos
  -m|--metaDataFile           Use this option when you can provide single json file in selected directory with meta data for WatchlistMember. In this case could be use any name for photo file
                              [
                              {

                              }
                              ]

  -p|--parallel               Max degree of parallelism, default value is 1
  -?|-h|--help                Show help information
```

Example:
```sh

```

#### softrestart

When config values are changed, they are not reflected immediately. To load changed configurations of you need to call softrestart command.

Example:
```sh
$ sfcli --url http://localhost:8099 softrestart
```

#### video

This command allow to create, update or view settings of videoProcessor. VideoProcessor is domain entity which groups some data entities, workers and configs. That alows you to add live stream from IP camera and easily change processing properties.

NOTE: stream id is used as unique identifier of videoProcessor

```

```sh
$ sfcli --url http://localhost:8099 video add -v:c:\temp\wafs.mp4
```
Example (start videoProcessor):
```sh
$ sfcli --url http://localhost:8099 video set -e:true -s:1
```

##### video add
